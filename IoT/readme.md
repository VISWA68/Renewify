# ESP32 IoT Integration for Renewify

This folder contains the ESP32 code (`esp32.ino`) for monitoring solar panel performance and battery status. The IoT solution seamlessly integrates with the **Renewify** app, sending real-time data to Firebase and enabling users to monitor key metrics directly in the app.

---

## 📋 Features

- **Voltage Monitoring**: Tracks the voltage generated by the solar panels.
- **Current Monitoring**: Measures the current produced.
- **Battery Monitoring**: Monitors:
  - Battery voltage
  - Battery percentage
  - Consumed current
- **Real-Time Updates**: Sends the collected data to Firebase for real-time visualization in the Renewify app.

## ⚙️ Components Required

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**
- Voltage and Current Sensors (e.g., INA219 or similar)
- Battery Monitoring Module
- Solar Panel (for testing)
- Connecting wires and breadboard

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install the **Arduino IDE** from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Install the following libraries in the Arduino IDE:
  - `FirebaseESP32`
  - `WiFi`
  - `Adafruit_Sensor` (if using sensors requiring this library)

### 2. Setting Up Firebase
- Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Add the Firebase Realtime Database to the project.
- Get the Firebase project credentials:
  - Database URL
  - API Key
- Replace the placeholders in the code with your Firebase credentials.

### 3. Setting Up WiFi
- Update the `esp32.ino` file with your WiFi credentials:
  ```cpp
  #define WIFI_SSID "Your_SSID"
  #define WIFI_PASSWORD "Your_Password"
  ```

### 4. Uploading Code to ESP32
- Connect your ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.
- Open `esp32.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
- Select the appropriate board and port under **Tools**.
- Click on **Upload** to flash the code onto the ESP32.

## 📊 Data Flow

1. Sensors collect voltage, current, and battery data.
2. The ESP32 processes the data and calculates battery percentage and consumed current.
3. Data is sent to Firebase in real-time using the `FirebaseESP32` library.
4. The Renewify app fetches and displays the data dynamically.

## 🔄 Real-Time Monitoring in the App

- Users can monitor:
  - Current and voltage generated by the solar panels.
  - Battery percentage and consumed current.
  - Historical data for insights and predictions.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **WiFi Not Connecting**: Double-check your WiFi credentials and ensure the ESP32 is within range.
- **No Data in Firebase**: Verify the Firebase credentials in the code and check the database rules.
- **Incorrect Sensor Readings**: Ensure proper sensor calibration and connections.
